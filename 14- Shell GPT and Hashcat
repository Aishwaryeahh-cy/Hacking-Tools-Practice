Shell GPT and Hashcat Learning Project
This project documents my learning experience with Shell GPT and Hashcat. These tools combine artificial intelligence with cybersecurity techniques to improve command-line productivity and password security testing.

Shell GPT (sgpt) is a terminal-based AI assistant that allows users to generate, explain, and execute commands using natural language.

### Features
- Converts natural language into shell commands
- Helps debug terminal errors
- Generates scripts and automation commands
