# Burp Suite
Burp Suite is a web application security testing tool.
- Works as an intercepting proxy between browser and server
- Captures HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses
- Allows modifying and resending requests
- Used to find web vulnerabilities

Why I practiced it:
- To understand how web traffic works
- To analyze requests and responses
- To learn basic web security testing
